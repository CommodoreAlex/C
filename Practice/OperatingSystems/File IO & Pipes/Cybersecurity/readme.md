# Named Pipes & Process Forking: DFIR Implications

## Overview

In **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**, understanding **inter-process communication (IPC)** mechanisms like **named pipes (`FIFO`)** and **process forking** is crucial for identifying **malware behaviors**, **covert execution**, and **adversarial persistence tactics**.

## Why It Matters

Attackers commonly leverage **pipes and forked processes** to:
- Evade detection with **subprocess spawning**.
- Create **hidden IPC channels** for stealthy data exfiltration.
- Redirect execution flows via **process injection**.

## Named Pipes (`FIFO`) in DFIR

### Key Insights

- Named pipes (`mkfifo`) **persist in the filesystem**, unlike anonymous pipes.
- Malware often abuses **FIFO pipes** for **covert data exchange** between processes.
- Detection involves **active monitoring of open pipes**.

### Forensic Techniques
#### Detecting Active Named Pipes

Use `lsof` to identify running processes interacting with FIFOs:
```sh
lsof | grep fifo
```

#### Finding All Named Pipes

Scan the system for unexpected FIFO files:
```bash
find / -type p 2>/dev/null
```

#### Auditing Pipe Activity

Monitor read/write operations on named pipes for **exfiltration attempts**:
```bash
auditctl -w /path/to/fifo -p rwxa -k fifo_monitor
```

## Process Forking in DFIR

### Key Insights

- **Forking (**`pid = fork();`**) creates child processes**, often abused by malware.
    
- Attackers use **fork bombs** or **process chaining** to evade forensic tools.
    
- Detecting **child process anomalies** is critical for **malware analysis**.
    

### Forensic Techniques

#### Identifying Forking Behavior

Trace system calls to detect process spawning:
```bash
strace -p <pid> -e fork,execve
```

#### Tracking Hidden Child Processes

Use `pstree` for a hierarchical view:
```bash
pstree -p | grep <suspicious_process>
```

#### Monitoring Fork Injection Attempts

Check for **unusual parent-child relationships**:
```bash
ps -axjf
```

---
## Adversarial Tactics and Evasion Strategies

Attackers leverage **named pipes and forks** to:

- Hide **data exfiltration channels** through FIFO pipes.
    
- **Re-execute malicious payloads** via child processes.
    
- Bypass logging mechanisms by **redirecting execution flows**.
